            <h1>Burr Tools</h1>
            <p>
            This (set of) program(s) will help you solve a certain kind of puzzle. Namely puzzles that
            are made out "glued" together basic units. As basic units the program currently supports:
            square or dice shaped units, spheres, prisms with an equilateral triangle as base
            or 2 grids that use tetrahedra.
            <p>
            The problem of the puzzle must be to assemble them into a certain shape. An additional
            constraint says that the pieces within the result shape must again aligned relative to the
            grid of the basic unit.
            <p>
            To whet your appetite here are some screenshots that show off all the important features of the
            program. If you click the images a normal sized version of the window will be loaded.

            <p>There are also 2 videos available that show how a puzzle is entered and solved using
            BurrTools. The puzzle that is used can be found 
            <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rh5k-isn/Puzzle/ChocolateDipBurr">here<img src='images/extern.png'></a>.
            The video is divided
            into 2 parts. <a href="data/part1.avi">Part&nbsp;1<img src='images/extern.png'></a> contains 
            the creation of the shapes and solves the puzzle the first time.
            <a href="data/part2.avi">Part&nbsp;2<img src='images/extern.png'></a> adds colours to the shapes to make the
            puzzle complete and the solution unique. The files are 2 and 1.5MBytes big.
            <p>
            You can also find a <a href="data/rdTutorial.pdf">tutorial<img src='images/extern.png'></a> made by Lee Krasnow that explains the Rhombic Grid.
            <p>
            So what are the features
            <ul>
              <li>Does nearly all that PuzzleSolver 3D which is
              <ul>
                <li>You can enter all puzzles that are assembled out of dice shaped units
                <li>Find assemblies for you puzzle
                <li>Disassemble the found assemblies
                <li>Show everything in a 3 dimensional image
                <li>Animate how the puzzle has to be assembled
                <li>Toggle the visibility of pieces in the solution to have a look at the inner workings of
                    a puzzle. This is especially helpful for box packing puzzles
              </ul>
              <li>Runs on Windows, OSX, Linux, FreeBSD and probably other Unix variants as well.
              <li>Has several different grids (Cubes, Triangles, Spheres, Rhombics)
              <li>You can specify which cubes to fill and which can be empty or full. PuzzleSolver 3D has
                  only 2 modes. Either all cubes may be left empty in the solution, or the cubes that have
                  an empty neighbour must be filled. BurrTools are more flexible here.
              <li>More than one problem in one file (e.g. have several Soma Cube problems in the
                  same file)
              <li>Constraints to piece placements (like checkerboard)
              <li>Group pieces together to tell the disassembler that they don't need to be taken apart.
                  This is necessary for puzzles like "Cube In Cage" where the cage can not be taken apart
                  but has 3 movable pieces
              <li>No limits (or at least very high limits) to sizes and number of shapes. As long as your 
                  computer has the memory and
                  you the patience the program will do it for you, even if it takes aeons.
              <li>Create <a href="images/imageexportexample.png">images<img src='images/extern.png'></a> 
                  that contain the pieces, or an instruction how to assemble the puzzle, or create
                  vector images for further processing
              <li>Create files suitable for STL aware hard and software (e.g. 3D printer)
              <li>Free as in beer. It doesn't cost you anything
              <li>Free as in speech. The source is available, so you can do your own programming
                  or help me writing this software or even continue improving the program in case 
                  I have to stop working on it.
              <li>Save puzzles with solutions in compressed XML-files. This allows you to create
                  puzzles with other means (like your own burrgrower, ...)
              <li>A library is provided that helps you to write your own software for puzzle
                  design and analysis
              </ul>

            <p>I've been asked many times why I don't sell the program. For
            those that are interested 
            <A HREF="why-free.html">here<img src='images/extern.png'></A>
            I put up a small text explaining it.

            <h2>Documentation</h2>
            <p>
            To learn more about BurrTools you can read an online version of the user guide and the library
            documentation. The user guide documentation is also available as a PDF below in the download
            section and as help inside the program.
            <p>
            The library documentation explains the library interface and can be generated from the source
            code of the library using doxygen. This documentation is mainly for people wanting to use the
            library and only of limited use for those who only want to use the GUI part of BurrTools.
            <p>
            Both documents are always for the latest release and will be updated with each release.

                  <p>I want to use this nice date to announce that version 0.6.0 has been released. This version has the
                  following new features:
                  <ul>
                    <li>completely rewritten STL-export- and OpenGL-display-code, they do now share a
                    common base. With this come the following features:
                    <ul>
                      <li>STL export for all grids, including hollow shapes for all grids
                      <li>STL export preview in the STL export window, you see exactly what the STL
                      shape looks like
                      <li>for the programmers: it has become simpler to support new grids all polygon
                      based grids now can create proper STL output and code for the 3D display
                      much easier, grids like the spheres stay complicated, though
                      <li>bigger sensitive click spots for spheres, they also look better
                      <li>in the 3D view you can see the natural color and the color constraint color
                    </ul>
                    <li>improved STL export window (tooltips, ...)
                    <li>STL export displays the exact volume of the generated object
                    <li>add a new way how objects are rotated in the 3-D viewer
                  </ul>

                  <p>This version also fixes a few problems:
                  <ul>
                    <li>fix a problem loading puzzle files with complex groups
                    <li>deleting the last shape crashed the program
                    <li>make compilabe with gcc-4.4 and fltk-1.3
                  </ul>

                  <p>I want to thank Derek Bosch for his help in this release.
                  Although we had to start over twice he managed in the end to
                  come up with the bevel and offset code required for the STL
                  export.

                  <p>Version 0.5.2 has been released. This version is another bug-fix
                  release. But it also contains 2 small but nice new features:
                  <ul>
                    <li>STL export of hollow spheres. It is now possible to
                    generate hollow sphere for the 3d printer, saving you a
                    lot of volume and costs. Thanks to George Bell for this
                    feature.
                    <li>Improvements to the movement browser: in the cube grid
                    you can now push and pull pieces around by clicking onto
                    their faces and holding the Shift or Ctrl key down. Thanks
                    to Barry Downes for this feature.
                  </ul>

                  This version also fixes the following problems:

                  <ul>
                    <li>With some sphere puzzles BurrTools left in some
                    rotations, leaving you with too many solutions. Thanks to
                    ISHINO to give me a simple problem to investigate this
                    problem. Also thanks to Joe Becker who thought that there
                    was a problem but could not give me a simple example.
                    <li>Fix a bug when importing sphere shapes from assemblies.
                    This but caused a crash nearly every time you tries to do
                    that.
                    <li>Fix a bug in STL export for cubes that caused the
                    generation of faulty STL files with some cube
                    arrangements. Thanks to Derek Bosch for the fix.

                  release. It fixes 4 problems, some of them rather important, so please update.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Fix a problem in the new expensive rotation check
                    functionality that resulted in too few solutions
                    <li>Fix a rounding bug that happened when transforming

                    <li>Fix a crash when opening the status window with sphere
                    puzzles
                    <li>Deactivate movement browser when not available.
                    Opening it in those situations caused a crash
                    <li>Fix a possible crash when minimizing shapes

                  <p>Version 0.5.0 has been released.
                  <p>This is a major new release with a ton of new features
                  <p>But before we start with the features I want to mention an important bug-fix.
                  Joe Becker found this one. When you use piece ranges and assigned different
                  ranges to the 2 pieces of a mirror pair of pieces versions prior to this may
                  loose solutions, so I really urge you to update.
                  <p>But now finally let's start with the features. Again BurrTools learned a new
                  grid. The new grid is based on tetrahedra and octahedrons. With this grid you
                  can analyse the tetrahedra-puzzles form Interlocking Puzzles. I want to thank
                  Wayne Daniel who provided me with 2 example puzzles to test the new
                  functionality.
                  <p>Another great new feature is a disassembler for the triangle grid. You can not
                  analyse disassembly sequences for those puzzles. Be aware though that
                  coordinated motion moves are not supported by now.
                  <p>Also the printable manual has returned and it is better than ever. BurrTools
                  still contains the on-line help but if you want a proper manual you can
                  download that manual formatted for A4 or letter paper format. The size of the
                  manual has also reached more than 100 pages. It covers all the features of
                  BurrTools and contains a lot of hints and usage examples to make life easier.
                  <p>BurrTools now contains some features that can be used for piece generation. It
                  has become very easy to create all shapes that fulfil a certain property. It
                  will probably not help in all situations but many tedious manual tasks can be
                  simplified a lot. For that tasks I also speed up the status window
                  calculations by a huge amount.
                  <p>While we are talking about speed up. I replaced the sorting algorithm that
                  sorted solutions by a usable method. If you had more than a few solutions the
                  old algorithm was way too slow. I also replaced the whole save and load code.
                  The file format stayed the same but internally everything has changed. The new
                  code is much much faster. It also requires much less memory. This can be
                  important for big puzzles. The old code might fail to save an analysis because
                  it ran out of memory. This will no longer happen.
                  <p>I also optimized the disassembler to require less memory. It is now possible
                  to analyse disassembly of puzzles with many more internal states. I also
                  removed that stupid 256 piece limitation for the disassembler, so you can now
                  analyse puzzles with lots and lots of shapes.
                  <p>Besides these bigger improvements there are a lot of smaller things
                  <ul>
                    <li>add scrollwheel support for 3D view zoom
                    <li>millability and notchability in status window
                    <li>fix potential symmetry calculation problem with the rhombic grid
                    <li>different config file format, the old one is thrown away)
                    <li>fix a cursor drawing bug in the rhombic grid
                    <li>converter from cube to rhombic grid and from cube to tetra-octa grid
                    <li>add a simple movement browser to analyse the movements of pieces in an
                    assembled puzzle
                  </ul>

                  <p>One final remark. I will no longer support the windows installer. I can not
                  test that part of BurrTools on my computer. Lately I found out that there has
                  been a bug in the installer that has been there for a very long time and no
                  one cared to tell me. As I don't like to give out faulty software I will no
                  longer support that feature. You will have to live with the ZIP-archive. I
                  can look into the ZIP file and check everything is all right.

            <p>
            If you want to contribute changes, improvements, fixes or whatever I suggest you get yourself the 
            <a href="http://www.darcs.net">darcs</a><img src='images/extern.png'> revision control system. I 
            use that system for the development.

            <p>
            The repositories are read only, so if you want to send me your changes you have to use the send feature 
            of darcs. I will then apply the changes you made. The repository will be updated by me on a daily basis, 
            when development goes on.
